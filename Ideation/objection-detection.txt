Here is a structured presentation for your hackathon project based on the second code:

Problem Statement
Develop a real-time object detection and alert system to assist visually impaired individuals by providing auditory feedback on their surroundings.

Description (Target Audience)
This project aims to aid visually impaired individuals by detecting objects in their immediate environment and providing audio feedback to enhance situational awareness and safety. The system identifies objects, warns of potential hazards, and communicates the distance of approaching objects, making navigation safer and more intuitive for those with visual impairments.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow
Object Detection Model: SSD MobileNet v2
Image Processing Library: OpenCV
Text-to-Speech Library: pyttsx3
Visualization: cv2 (OpenCV)
Miscellaneous: NumPy for numerical operations, pytesseract for text detection
AI Model Available
Model Used: SSD MobileNet v2
Library: TensorFlow
Training: Pre-trained on the COCO dataset
Accuracy: Optimized for real-time performance
Input (Dataset)
Source: Live webcam feed
Data Type: Video frames captured from the webcam
Content: Real-time images of the user's surroundings
Output
Detection: Real-time identification of objects within the webcam's view.
Audio Alerts: Vocal notifications about detected objects, including warnings for objects that are too close (e.g., vehicles, bottles, people).
Visual Indicators: Bounding boxes and labels drawn on the video frames displayed to a live feed window.
Conclusion
This project leverages advanced object detection models and real-time image processing to create an assistive technology for visually impaired individuals. By providing timely auditory alerts about the user's environment, the system enhances mobility and safety, addressing a critical need for accessibility solutions. The integration of robust AI models and user-friendly interfaces demonstrates the potential for AI to make significant contributions to improving the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.
